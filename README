OSCam-emu: Open Source Conditional Access Module Emulator
=========================================================

OSCam-emu is an Oscam addon module to include emulator support and other functionality that collides with the goal of the original oscam developers.

This patch creates a virtual card reader which is configured automatically.
You may save the default reader configuration with the webif and then modify it to your own liking.

Key file ("SoftCam.Key"):
OSCam-emu does not require, but will make use of "SoftCam.Key" if available.
"SoftCam.Key" is searched in the oscam config folder (where oscam.conf is located) and also in "/var/keys".

You may use OSEmu instead and add it as a reader to your plain oscam server.
OSEmu can be found at https://github.com/oscam-emu/OSEmu

Supported systems
=================

Currently only the following crypto systems are available:
 - Cryptoworks
 - SoftNDS
 - Viaccess 1/2/3
 - Nagra 2
 - Irdeto 2
 
All of these are basically working, but far from complete so anyone filling in blanks is welcome...


TODO
====

Work has to be done on the following items:
 - Add other encryption systems


Version history
===============

OSCam-emu history is accessible through GitHub commits at:
   https://github.com/oscam-emu/oscam-emu


Building OSCam-emu from source
==============================

 - Get the lastest oscam sources from SVN:
    svn checkout http://www.streamboard.tv/svn/oscam/trunk oscam-svn

 - Save the oscam-emu.patch file
    wget https://github.com/oscam-emu/oscam-emu/raw/master/oscam-emu.patch

 - Go to oscam-svn directory.

 - Patch the source with the EMU patch:
    patch -p0 < ../oscam-emu.patch
    
 - OR: Instead of 'patch', you may also use 'svn patch':
    svn patch ../oscam-emu.patch
    
 - Put a SoftCam.Key file into the oscam-svn directory (for example from skystar.org)
   Note: This does not apply for Mac OSX, SoftCam.Key cannot be integrated on this system at the moment.
  
 - Run `./config.sh -g` to choose the features you want.

 - Run `make` to compile OSCam.


OSCam dvbapi config
===================

If dvbapi is activated, the "delayer" option is forced to have a value of at least 70.
This is to avoid freezes/crashes because of too fast ecm responses.
